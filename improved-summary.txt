My expertise spans modern JavaScript ecosystems, cloud-native architectures, and performance-optimized systems. I've successfully architected and deployed complex media processing pipelines, including an adaptive video player with automated captioning using React Native, Django, Celery, and cloud storage solutions. Through strategic query optimization and intelligent caching implementations, I've driven significant backend performance improvements.

I champion clean, maintainable code through type-safe development practices and robust CI/CD pipelines. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring emerging technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or mentoring aspiring developers in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
